            <p> Nestled on the Appalachian Trail, Bake Oven Knob is a perfect hike for a beginning hiker looking for a quick,
                easy trail with a spectacular lookout. The peak has become known for its paint-covered rocks. Bake Oven Knob
                is the tallest point in both the Lehigh and Carbon counties, reaching a peak of 1500 feet, with a narrow
                paved road leading you up close to the top of the mountain. If hiking from the parking lot, be prepared for
                a 0.4 mile hike towards the turnaround point. You should be able to reach the main lookout within 15 minutes,
                which adds up to a 30 minute round-trip. This hike starts off easy, but towards the middle be prepared for
                some climbing. Some portions of the trail can get quite rocky, so come prepared with solid footwear. At the
                end of the hike, you’ll be greeted by fantastic views of the Blue Mountain Ridge, as well as an expansive
                view of the area’s farmland. Many hikers travel here for hawk and eagle watching, but the trail has also
                become popular with graffiti artists.
